      COVID-19 as a global pandemic is testing the ability of the world's
      researchers to understand the impact of the disease as well as the
      efficacy and safety of the vaccines intended to prevent its spread. Real
      world data is being leveraged to aid in the efforts to track post
      marketing safety surveillence. In order to fully understand the nature of
      the rapidly evolving methods for identifying the vaccine information in
      real world evidence this paper evaluates a network of observational data
      sources for data elements and their likely mappings to the eventual data
      standards that can be reliably leveraged to extract research quality
      evidence from real world data sources.
      <div class="text-h6 mt-4">Methods</div>
      Queries were developed to expose the internal mappings of source values to
      their standardized concepts and further to the manufacturer.
