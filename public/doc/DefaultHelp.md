# ARES HELP

[toc]

## Background
ARES is A Research Exploration System designed for use in the study of patient level observational data that has been converted into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM).  ARES was developed by Frank DeFalco, a member of the Observational Health Data Sciences & Informatics (OHDSI) community.

### OHDSI
The Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (or OHDSI, pronounced "Odyssey") program is a multi-stakeholder, interdisciplinary collaborative to bring out the value of health data through large-scale analytics. All our solutions are open-source.  [Learn more about OHDSI](https://www.ohdsi.org).

## Visualizations
Visualizations are used throughout ARES to assist in the interpretation of information.  In this section sample visualizations are presented with descriptions to ensure they are well understood.

### Interpreting Box-Whisker Diagrams and Inter-Quartile Range (IQR)
Box-whisker diagrams present a simple picture representing the distribution of a set of data which include the values for the minimum, maximum, and quartiles of the distribution.  They are also known as boxplots.

![IQR](img/sample-iqr.png)
 - A - Lowest value
 - B - Lower Quartile (25%)
 - C - Median (50%)
 - D - Upper Quartile (75%)
 - E - Highest Value

## Roadmap
The roadmap for ARES is maintained on the github repository.

## OHDSI Libraries
ARES presents research generated through the suite of OHDSI related packages.
- Achilles
- Data Quality Dashboard
- Database Connector
- Sql Render
- Castor

## Open Source Ecosystem
ARES leverages many open source libraries and tools to achieve its goals without which the task would be entirely insurmountable.
- Vue
- Vuetify
- axios
- Vega
- Vega-lite
- vega-embed
- codemirror
- d3
- markdown-it
- markdown-it-vue
- npm
- lodash
- Material Design
